Semantic role labeling has seen tremendous progress in the last years, both for supervised and unsupervised approaches. The knowledge-based approaches have been neglected while they have shown to bring the best results to the related word sense disambiguation task. We contribute a simple knowledge-based approach with an easy to reproduce specification. We also present a novel approach to handle the passive voice in the context of semantic role labeling that reduces the error rate in F1 by 15.7\%, showing that significant improvements can be brought to the knowledge-based approaches while retaining key advantages of the approach: a simple approach which facilitates analysis of individual errors, does not need any hand-annotated corpora and which is not domain-specific.
