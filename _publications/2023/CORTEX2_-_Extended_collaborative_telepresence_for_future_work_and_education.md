In a recently launched European project {CORTEX}2, we are setting the basis for future extended collaborative telepresence to allow for remote cooperation in virtually all industrial and business sectors, both for productive work and education and training. Our idea merges the concepts of classical video-conferencing with extended reality, where real assets such as objects, machines or environment can be digitalized and shared with distant users for teamworking in a real-virtual continuous space. In essence, the {CORTEX}2 framework will allow the creation of shared working experiences between multiple distant users in different operating modes. In the Virtual Reality mode, participants will be able to create virtual meeting rooms where each user is represented by a virtual avatar. Participants will have the possibility to appear as video-based holograms in the virtual rooms, with an option to anonymise their appearance using a {AI}-based video appearance generator while keeping their original facial expressions. Participants will be able to exchange documents, 3D objects and other assets and will be accompanied by a {AI}-powered meeting assistant with extended capabilities such as natural speech interaction, meeting summarization or translation.
