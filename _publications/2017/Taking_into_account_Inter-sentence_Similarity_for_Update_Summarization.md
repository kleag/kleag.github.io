Following Gillick and Favre (2009), a lot of work about extractivesummarization has modeled this task by associating two contrary constraints:one aims at maximizing the coverage of the summary with respect to itsinformation content while the other represents its size limit. In this context,the notion of redundancy is only implicitly taken into account. In thisarticle, we extend the framework defined by Gillick and Favre (2009) byexamining how and to what extent integrating semantic sentence similarity intoan update summarization system can improve its results. We show more preciselythe impact of this strategy through evaluations performed on DUC 2007 and TAC2008 and 2009 datasets.
