In this paper we describe the implementation of Russian language pipeline in LIMA multilingual analyzer and the results obtained in GramEval-2020 shared task. LIMA is a modular pipeline that implements rule-based and machine learning analysis components. Russian language pipeline includes deep neural networks based modules for tokenization, sentence segmentation, part of speech tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing. Part of speech tags, feature tags and dependency trees conform to Universal Dependencies rules.
