We developed a system, {SVETLAN}', dedicated to the acquisition of classes of semantically close nouns from texts. We aim at constructing a structured lexicon for the general language, that is not for representing a specialized domain. Thus, texts are open-domain newspaper articles. The acquisition is based on a distributional method that groups the nouns that are related to a same verb with a same functional role. However, in order to deal with polysemy, classes are learned in context: they are built from text segments related to a same semantic domain. For that, we use results of {ROSA}, a system that clusters automatically segmented text thematic units in order to build semantic domain defined by sets of weighted words. We will show how these classes can be used to expand queries, in comparison with an expansion realized by using {WordNet}.
